# Onsets and Frames Study
This is my attempt to understand the Automatic Music Transcription space using Onsets and Frames as a base for my studies. I intend to cover enough information that is sufficient to grant me the needed understanding: this could mean math equations, papers, blog posts etc. This information will be collated into this repo and is free for anyone to access. This project will culminate in me creating an Automatic Music Transcription VST plugin.
